# Heat equation in 2D
Solved using semi-implicit time discretization. The code allows inclusion of any type and number of "holes" in the rectangular region
and it is assumed that no diffusion occurs across holes. 

The code files are organised as follows:
1. **heat.m** contains code to implement heat diffusion on a rectangular grid. 
2. **dirichlet.m** conatins code for the Dirichlet bcs. **neumann.m** similarly. 
3. **location.m** contains code to look for closest point inside the region. 

Thanks for visiting :)
